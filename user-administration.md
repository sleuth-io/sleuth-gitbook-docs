  (Role-Based Access Control)

# Permission Controls

Sleuth uses a role-based access control \(RBAC\) method to restrict access based on the roles of users within a Sleuth organization. Each organization has an owner, who can then assign roles to members of their organization. These roles  can manage members who can then make changes to the organization's integrations. 

With these permission controls, you can apply granular rights to users based on their role. Different roles control what parts of Sleuth your users can see and change: 

* **Owner**: The organization owner that cannot be removed. 
* **Administrator**: Can do anything. 
* **Developer**: Can add integrations, deployments, but not users. 
* **Observer**: Can view deployment information but can't change anything.

To check it out, go to **Organization Settings &gt; Members**, then select the cog dropdown next to the user to change their role:
