# Slack settings

The Slack Notifications tab is where you can configure which Slack channels receive change notifications when a deploy occurs in a specific environment. 

{% hint style="info" %}
The Slack integration must be made at the organization level first before configuring notification settings at the project level. Additionally, any private Slack channels will need to invite the "Sleuth" bot to the channel first before it can start receiving notifications. 
{% endhint %}
