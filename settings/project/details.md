# Details

The **Details** tab contains general information about the selected **project**. The name of selected project is displayed at the top of the sidebar, under **Project**. Select the dropdown to select a different project, if you have more than one.

You can change the name of your project in the Details tab, along with an optional **Description** for the project. This is helpful if you are on a large team with multiple projects within the organization.

You can also change the default issue tracker for the selected project and, if a [Build](../../integrations-1/builds/) integration has been established, a default build server. Selecting a build server is optional, but at least one default [issue tracker](../../integrations-1/issue-trackers/) or [code deployment](../../integrations-1/change-sources/code-deployment/) must be selected for your project. A link to enable an issue tracker is provided if the integration has not yet been made in the organization.

Only certain members can create an integration for the organization. See [Access Control](../access-control.md) for more information.
