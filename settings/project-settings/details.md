# Details

The Details tab contains general information about the selected project. The name of selected project is displayed at the top, next to **Project Settings**. In the example displayed below, _Sleuth_ is the name of the active project. 

You can also change the default issue tracker for the selected project and, if a [Build](../../integrations-1/builds/) integration has been established, a default build server. 

Selecting a build server is optional, but at least one [issue tracker](../../integrations-1/issue-trackers/) must be integrated and set as the default. A link to enable an issue tracker is provided if the integration has not been made by the organization the project belongs to. 

Press **Save** to save any modifications made in the Details tab.
