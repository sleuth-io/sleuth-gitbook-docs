# User Administration

Sleuth uses a role-based access control \(RBAC\) method to restrict access based on the roles of users within a Sleuth organization. Each organization has an administrator, who can then assign roles to members of their organization. These roles mostly manage members who can make changes to the organization's integrations. 

The following roles are provided for members of a Sleuth organization: 

* Organization Administrator
* Project Administrator
* Developer
* Member
