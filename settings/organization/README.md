# Organization

{% hint style="warning" %}
Only Owners and Administrators can access Organization settings. 
{% endhint %}

The following settings can be configured for the Sleuth organization: 

| Setting | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| \*\*\*\*[**Details**](details.md)\*\*\*\* | General information about the organization |
| \*\*\*\*[**Signup**](signup.md)\*\*\*\* | Set the email domain for auto-joining by new members |
| \*\*\*\*[**Members**](members.md)\*\*\*\* | Manage invitations and member roles for your organization |
| \*\*\*\*[**Billing**](billing.md)\*\*\*\* | Choose a new Sleuth plan for your organization |

Owners and Administrators \(see [Access Control](../../access-control.md) for more information about roles\) in Sleuth can make changes to the organization, which affects all users and projects that belong to that organization.

Some integrations allow project- and user-level settings to be made, such as the [Slack integration](../../integrations-1/chat-ops/slack.md). For example, a project could generate a Slack message when a deploy occurs, but a user might only want to receive a Slack message if the deploy is **not** healthy.
