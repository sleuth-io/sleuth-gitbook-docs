# Billing

The **Billing** tab allows the organization owner to manage billing information for their organization. 

An Owner or Administrator can change the pricing plan by selecting a new plan and pressing **Choose**. For Enterprise plans, you will need to [contact us](mailto:support@sleuth.io). 

Current plan usage is also displayed under **Plan**. In the example below, 14 team members exist at the Developer or above role so the cost is $140.
