# Organization

Owners and Administrators \(see [Access Control](../access-control.md) for more information about roles in Sleuth\) in Sleuth are able to make changes to the organization that affects all users and projects that belong to that organization. Some integrations allow project- and user-level settings to be made, such as the [Slack integration](../integrations-1/chat-ops/slack.md). For example, a project could generate a Slack message when a deploy occurs, but a user might only want to receive a Slack message if the deploy is **not** healthy. 

The following settings can be configured for the Sleuth organization: 

| Setting | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Details** |  |
| **Signup** |  |
| **Members** |  |
| **Billing** |  |
