# GS Draft 2

Getting started with Sleuth will take no more than 10 minutes.Here is a list of things we'll do to get you going: 

* [ ] Create a Sleuth account. 
* [ ] Create an organization. 
* [ ] Create a project. 
* [ ] Set up a **change source**, such as a code deployment in GitHub or feature flags in LaunchDarkly.
* [ ] Invite others to join your organization. 

Once your Sleuth account is up and running, here is how you can take it to the next level: 

* **Add a ChatOps integration.** Send and receive team and personal Slack notifications. If you don't use Slack, you can use Sleuth's built-in email notifications.

* **Add an impact integration.** Sleuth supports popular tools for tracking errors and metrics. **Bugsnag**, **Datadog**, **Honeybadger**, **Rollbar**, **Sentry**, and **SignalFx** are some of the integrations you can make with Sleuth.

* **Add an issue tracker.** You probably use **Clubhouse**, **Jira**, or **Linear** to keep your development tasks on track. Let Sleuth automatically connect your issues with your deploys for more fruitiful post-mortems.
