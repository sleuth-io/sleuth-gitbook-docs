# Signing up

Before you ****get started, you must first sign up by [creating an account](https://app.sleuth.io/account/signup/). Once that's done, we'll connect to your code repo:

If you already have a **Google**, **GitHub** or **Bitbucket** account, you can login with those instead. After you have successfully logged in, you can get started by creating your first Sleuth [Project](projects.md#creating-a-project).
