# Signing up

Before you ****get started, you must first [create an account](https://app.sleuth.io/account/signup/). Once that's created, we'll connect to a repo, either GitHub or Bitbucket.

If you already have a Google, GitHub or Bitbucket account, you can sign up with those instead. After you have successfully logged in, you can get started by creating your first Sleuth [Project](projects.md#creating-a-project).
