# Notifications

In addition to the available [Chat Ops](integrations-1/chat-ops/) integrations, Sleuth can notify you and your team when something happens with your source of change. 

### Setting up Slack notifications

Before you set up project-level Slack notifications, the [Slack integration](integrations-1/chat-ops/slack.md#about-the-integration) must be made the Sleuth organization level first. Once that's done, you can configure who and how those notifications are sent and who receives them. 

#### To setup Slack notifications for the project

1. Select the project in the sidebar. 
2. Click **Project Settings** in the sidebar. 
3. Click **Slack Notifications**. 
4. In the _Slack channel_ dropdown, start typing the name of the Slack channel that will receive change notifications. If the channel is private, you will need to invite the _Sleuth bot_ to the channel first.  ![](.gitbook/assets/slack-config-channels.png)
