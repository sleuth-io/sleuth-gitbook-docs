# Command Center

The **Command Center** is the single pane of glass through which you can view your entire DevOps stack. Sleuth aggregates all of the data your disparate tools generate and presents it to you in a clean, easy-to-use interface. 

From the Command Center you can see all of your code deployments, feature flags, manual changes, and impact sources, along with previous, current, and future deploy events. You can also quickly evaluate drift between your environments, view project trends across your various code and flag deploys, and get a historical snapshot of the health of your code.
