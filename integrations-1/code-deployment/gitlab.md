# GitLab

## About the integration ![](../../.gitbook/assets/gitlab-logo.svg) 

Integrating GitLab with Sleuth is simple. If you're connecting to a personal GitLab repo, you just need your credentials. If you're part of an organization and aren't the owner, you will need permission to allow Sleuth to connect to the repoâ€”after you connect you'll be able to select individual private or public repositories.

#### Check out this video by Sleuth CTO Don Brown on how to get started with Sleuth and GitLab

## Setting up the integration

To set up the GitLab integration: 

1. Click **Integrations** in the left sidebar, then click **Change Sources**. 
2. In the _GitLab_ tile, click **enable**. 
3. You must grant Sleuth access to your GitLab account. Don't worry, you'll select the GitLab repo to connect to your Sleuth project later. \

4. On successful integration, _GitLab enabled_ will be displayed in the GitLab tile. You'll next configure the code deployment to connect your repo to a project. 

## Configuring the integration

You now need to add a [code deployment](../../modeling-your-deployments/code-deployments/) for your GitLab repo to a Sleuth [project](../../modeling-your-deployments/projects/). Once configured and you start [registering deploys](../../modeling-your-deployments/code-deployments/how-to-register-a-deploy.md) Sleuth will be tracking deploys for your code changes.To configure the GitLab integration: 

1. After step #4 above, you will be taken back to the GitLab integration tile. On the GitLab tile, click the **Add code deployment** dropdown. 
2. Select the [Sleuth project](../../modeling-your-deployments/projects/) you wish to add a chance source to from the dropdown list. 
3. Follow the instructions for [setting up a new code deployment](../../settings/project/code-deployments.md)

## Removing the integration

#### If you wish to dissolve the **GitLab** integration for the organization: 

1. Click on **Integrations** in the left sidebar, then on **Change Sources**. 
2. In the GitLab integration card, click **disable**.

The GitLab integration is disconnected and no longer available to any projects within that organization.
