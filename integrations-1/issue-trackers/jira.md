## About the Integration ![](../../.gitbook/assets/jira-software-2x-blue%20%281%29.png) 

The Jira integration allows Sleuth to use Jira as deployment issue tracker. When you deploy, Sleuth will automatically connect your Jira issues to the deploys, so you can always find the source of your changes later. 

The Jira integration is made at the Sleuth organization level. More than one [issue tracker](./) can be integrated into an organization. Although you can have multiple projects within an organization, each project can only use one issue tracker at a time.
