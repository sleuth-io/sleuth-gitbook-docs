# Clubhouse

## About the integration

The Clubhouse integration allows Sleuth to use Clubhouse as a deployment issue tracker. When you deploy, Sleuth will automatically connect your Cliubhouse issues to the deploys, so you can always find the source of your changes later. 

Integration with Clubhouse is made at the Sleuth organization level. More than one [issue tracker](./) can be integrated with an organization. Although you can have multiple projects within an organization, each project can only configured to use a single issue tracker. 

## Setting up the integration

To set up the Sleuth Clubhouse integration:

1. Click **Integrations** in the left sidebar, then click **Issue Trackers**. 
2. In the _Clubhouse_ tile, click **connect**. 
3. The Clubhouse icon turns green and the message **Jira is connected** is displayed in the tile.
