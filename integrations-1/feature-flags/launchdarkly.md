# LaunchDarkly

## About the integration ![](../../.gitbook/assets/launchdarkly\_rgb\_mark-black.png)&#x20;

Feature flags are an integral part of agile software development, and an important variable in deploying a successful CI/CD pipeline. Making high-impact changes with minimal risk and maximum control of your applications helps deliver quality software to your customers.&#x20;

The Sleuth LaunchDarkly integration provides a powerful way to track how your feature flags affect the quality of your deploys over time. The LaunchDarkly integration enables Sleuth to track changes made via your LaunchDarkly features flags.
