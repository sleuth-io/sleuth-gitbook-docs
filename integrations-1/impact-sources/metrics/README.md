# Metric trackers

**Metric trackers** or Observability tools track impacts from key stats reported by your applications. Connect to your cloud metrics provider to Sleuth so Sleuth can automatically verify the health of your deploys. Sleuth uses anomaly detection to determine your teams healthy range for a metric and will alert you and mark deploys as unhealthy when the metrics are outside of your normal range. Metrics data are displayed on the [health graph](../../../dashboard-1/dashboard.md)s throughout the application.
