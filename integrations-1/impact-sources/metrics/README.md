# Metric trackers

**Metric trackers** or Observability tools track SLIs and data from key stats reported by your applications. Connect to your cloud metrics provider to Sleuth so we can automatically verify the health of your deploys. Sleuth uses anomaly detection to determine your teams healthy range for a metric and will alert you and mark deploys as unhealthy when the metrics are outside of your normal range. 

Impact tracking is different from alerting. Alerting is when a metric is in such bad shape that your system is in strife and the on-call must be contacted. Impact lets you know when a metrics has changed in a significant way. For example, a new code change uses 5% more memory across your server fleet. 

Metrics data are displayed on the health graphs throughout the application.
