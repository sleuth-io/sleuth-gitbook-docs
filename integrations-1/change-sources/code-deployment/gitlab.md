# GitLab

## About the Integration ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/gitlab-logo.svg) 

Code deployments are one of the key sources of change Sleuth needs to do its job. Once a code deployment is integrated as a change of source, Sleuth immediately begins its analysis, looking at your commit history, number of authors, deploy frequency, size of commits, and other data to give you a full picture of how you and your team are managing your project's codebase. You'll instantly see the [Trend Graph](../../../resources/terminology.md#dashboard) come to life with a complete snapshot that gives you the information you need to start deploying faster.

Integrating GitLab with Sleuth is simple. If you're setting connecting to a personal GitLab repo, you just need your credentials. If you're part of an organization and aren't the owner, you will need permission to allow Sleuth to connect to the repo \(after you connect you'll be able to select individual private or public repositories\).

You can connect as many repositories to a project as you'd like; be sure to name them accordingly in Sleuth. You will also be able to tell Sleuth whether it should [manually register](../../manual-changes.md) each deploy or automatically create deploys for every push to or tag on branch; it's completely up to you. This setting can be changed at any time. Additionally, you can configure your target branch to [lock](../../../resources/terminology.md#locking) if it contains unreleased code.

Check out the [Bitbucket](bitbucket.md), [GitHub](github.md), [Jira](../../issue-trackers/jira.md), or [Clubhouse](../../issue-trackers/clubhouse.md) integration pages if you'd like to track your issues using those tools instead of or in addition to GitLab.
