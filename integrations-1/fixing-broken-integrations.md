# Fixing broken integrations

Sleuth proactively checks for broken integrations and, when it finds them, displays a warning icon in the top navigation.&#x20;

This icon links to a central "Needs attention" page that lists any broken integrations that Sleuth detects along with instructions on how to resolve them.&#x20;
