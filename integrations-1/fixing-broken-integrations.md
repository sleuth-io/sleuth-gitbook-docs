# Fixing broken integrations

Sleuth proactively checks for broken integrations and, when it finds them, displays a warning icon in the top navigation.&#x20;

The warning icon links to a global **Needs attention** page that lists any broken integrations that Sleuth detects along with instructions on how to resolve them.&#x20;

Sleuth continuous to automatically check connections, and once a previously identified connection issue appears to have been resolved, Sleuth removes that item from the **Needs attention** screen.&#x20;
