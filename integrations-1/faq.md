## How should I represent environments in Sleuth?

Currently, the way to represent your environments in Sleuth is to model them as [projects](../projects.md). Create a new project for each environment, such as staging, production, development, etc., and then map change sources, deployments, feature flags, etc., to each environment individually. 

We will introduce full-featured environment support to Sleuth very soon, so stay tuned. 

## How do I connect to my organization? 

Someone on your team might have already created a Sleuth project, and connected integrations already. Instead of creating a new account and project from scratch, you can join their organization, which can be your team or your company. If you use the same email address domain, you can automatically connect to their environment, which will give you access to all their projects and integrations. Read more here.
