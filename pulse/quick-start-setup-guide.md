# Quick Start setup guide

This guide is for an **administrator** setting up Sleuth for the first time. It takes only 15 minutes as long as you have:

* **Jira** admin API token (and email address)
* **GitHub** admin access (with permission to install GitHub apps)

{% hint style="info" %}
Don't use these tools? No problem! Sleuth supports lots of others, and you can find their prerequisites [here](https://app.gitbook.com/s/zDRqdmp82CqDZoh8RBye/general-settings/integrations).
{% endhint %}

### Connect your Issue Tracker and Git tool

Your issue tracker and Git repository give Sleuth most of what it needs to understand the work teams are doing, so start with these. Refer to [Integrations](https://app.gitbook.com/s/zDRqdmp82CqDZoh8RBye/general-settings/integrations) for details on how to connect these and other integrations.&#x20;

### Create a Review

Create a test review to confirm that issues and pull requests are flowing into Sleuth.

1. [Sign in](https://app.pulse.sleuth.io/sign-in) to Pulse.&#x20;
2.  Click **New review** in the top-right corner of the home screen.

3.  Select the **Monthly State of Engineering** review template.

4.  Wait a few seconds for the review to load, then scroll down to the _**DORA**_ section. If you see data in these widgets, then your pull requests are flowing into Sleuth.&#x20;

5.  Scroll down to the _**Delivery activity**_ section of the review. If you see data in the widgets in this section, then your issues are flowing into Sleuth.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
If the widgets in either of the sections above are empty, [contact support](mailto:support@sleuth.io).&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### What next?

Depending on how you plan to roll out Sleuth, common next steps might be to connect [Slack](https://app.gitbook.com/s/zDRqdmp82CqDZoh8RBye/general-settings/integrations/slack), invite [users](https://app.gitbook.com/s/zDRqdmp82CqDZoh8RBye/general-settings/users-and-teams#invite-users), or create [Teamspaces](https://app.gitbook.com/s/zDRqdmp82CqDZoh8RBye/teamspaces).&#x20;
