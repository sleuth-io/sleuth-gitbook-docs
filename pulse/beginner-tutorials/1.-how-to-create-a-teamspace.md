3.  Give your Teamspace a name that makes it clear to other user that it's your own personal Teamspace (e.g. "Jane Doh's Teamspace"), then click **Continue**.

7. Finally, to make sure you can easily find your Teamspace for future tutorials, click the ellipsis to the right of the Teamspace name and select **Pin**. This "pins" your Teamspace to the top of your left-hand-navigation so that it's easy for you to find as other users add thier own Teamspaces to Sleuth over time.\
