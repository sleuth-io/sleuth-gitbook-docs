# Project notifications

When your team is deploying frequently keeping everyone in the loop about what's changing is crucial.

Project-level team Slack notifications provide the context your teams need to keep the code flowing â€”automated, easily-digestable messages for:

* when your deploy occurred
* what was deployed
* who were the authors of the deploy
* how many commits, PRs, issues, and changes were in the deploy
* any issues associated with the deploy
* the [auto-generated health](../auto-verify-your-deploys/) of the deploy

Team notifications are flexible and Sleuth allows you to configure a different channel for each Sleuth [environment](../modeling-your-deployments/environment-support.md).
