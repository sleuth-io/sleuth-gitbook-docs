# Slack mission control

Slack is where developers live, Sleuth understands this and provides a deep Slack integration so you can get the right notifications and get your deploy-related work done without having to leave Slack.

Sleuth's [Slack integration](../integrations-1/slack.md) is your mission control for all your deploy needs, providing:

* [Team notifications](team-notifications.md) for deploys and health impact, keep everyone informed
* [Personal notifications](personal-notifications.md) so you know right when your code ships and its impact
* [Search your deploys](search-sleuth-in-slack.md) to find out if your code or that fix you've been waiting on has shipped
* [Instant standup reports](developer-standup.md), let Sleuth remember what you've worked on today
* [Collect approvals](https://help.sleuth.io/actions/cookbook#slack-approvals-based-promotion) via a üëç to promote deploys to new environments (beta feature)
