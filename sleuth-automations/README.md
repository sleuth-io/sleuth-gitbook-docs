# Sleuth Automations

## Overview

Sleuth Automations is a powerful capability that help teams effortlessly drive improvements across their entire software delivery workflow!&#x20;

And Sleuth Automations is much more than just a collection of automated tools to improve. It's a way to answer the question: _We've identified some bottlenecks, so now what?_ &#x20;

By [suggesting automations](smart-suggestions.md) that are designed to address your specific opportunities for improvement, and by providing [efficacy feedback](understanding-efficacy.md) to understand which automations are making a difference to your teams, Sleuth Automations combine with Sleuth's powerful DORA metrics to provide a full-circle continuous improvement solution.  &#x20;
