### Viewing smart suggestions

On the Project Metrics and Team Metrics dashboards, when a DORA metric or sub-metric has worsened by 30% or more compared to the prior period, Sleuth displays a suggestion prompt like the one in the screen shot above.&#x20;

Click **View automations** to navigate to a pre-filtered view of the Automations Marketplace, where you easily view all available automations that are tagged with your ailing metric.

When multiple metrics have worsened by 30% or more, the suggestion prompt will also include a **More suggestions** link. Click it to view the additional suggestions. Click the arrow next to any suggestion to view automations designed to help that specific metic.

### Dismissing smart suggestions

Click the **X** in the top-right corner of the suggestion banner to dismiss all smart suggestions for the remainder of your current Sleuth session.&#x20;

Click **Don't show again for this metric** to more permanently dismiss suggestions for a specific metric. Suggestions for that metric will remain suppressed across all Projects and Teams for your Sleuth user. You can re-enable suggestions at any time by clearing your browser cache.
