# Automations Marketplace

Sleuth's **Automations Marketplace** provides a rich offering of [easy-to-install](installing-automations.md) automations designed to help teams drive improvements across their entire software delivery workflow!&#x20;

### Getting there

Access the Automations Marketplace either by clicking the **Marketplace** item in Sleuth's top navigation or by navigating directly to [marketplace.sleuth.io](http://marketplace.sleuth.io)

### Automation Types

The Automations Marketplace is categorized into 4 main "types" of automations:

* **PR Checks** analyze pull requests to ensure they conform to industry best practices, cutting down review time and improving morale by relieving reviewers of the onus of “policing” these best practices. Think of them as linters for your PR process!
* **Notifications** drive awareness and help teams respond quickly by automatically alerting them in Slack or Microsoft Teams when Sleuth determines there’s something they need to know.
* **Actions** provide a variety of simple, targeted automations across your software delivery tool chain, like automatically transitioning or commenting on a Jira issue to let stakeholders know immediately when a code change they care about has deployed to its target environment.
* **Workflows** provide powerful automations that can evaluate multiple conditions and execute complex actions across that tool chain. The example I love to use here is auto-promoting a build from Staging to Production once Sleuth determines that it’s had a good soak. Sleuth can do that because it knows exactly when that change hit that environment, it knows the status of all of the monitoring tools connected to that environment, and has the ability to trigger a build in your integrated CI/CD platform.

### Additional Automation Tags

In addition to the 4 automation types above, automations are further tagged by the following dimensions. Simply click on the corresponding items in the left-hand navigation of the Automations Marketplace to filter automations that match these tags:

* **Category** describes which aspects of your software delivery process each automation is designed to improve.\

* **DORA** tags allow you to search for automations designed to improve a specific DORA metric (or sub-metric). Sleuth also uses these DORA tags to [suggest specific automations](smart-suggestions.md) in the context of your unique bottlenecks.\
