## Sleuth has multiple User Roles. Are they all charged the same?&#x20;

Sleuth provides RBAC with 4 roles; Administrator, Developer, Observer and Billing. All roles other than the Billing role are a fully paid Sleuth user and have access to read and explore DORA metrics. The Billing role is for an organizations billing admin and only has access to the Organizations billing page and invoices. Sleuth also has a concept of Contributor. A Contributor is a reference to a user in external systems (such as a source control or issue tracker). Contributors can be added to Sleuth Teams so you have the ability to fully model your Teams to get accurate DORA metrics without having to add every member of your organization as a paid Sleuth user. Standard plans are allowed up to 50 contributors for free and Enterprise plans can add unlimited Contributors.
