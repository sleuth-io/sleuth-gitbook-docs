# FAQ

## How are environments represented in Sleuth?

Currently, the way to represent your environments in Sleuth is to model them as [projects](../projects.md). Create a new project for each environment, such as staging, production, development, etc., and then map change sources, deployments, feature flags, etc., to each environment individually. 

We will introduce full-featured environment support to Sleuth very soon, so stay tuned. 

## How do I connect to my organization? 

Someone on your team might have already created a Sleuth project and made some integrations. Instead of creating a new account and project from scratch, you can join their organization, which can be your team or your company. 

If your email address domains match, you will automatically connect to the organization, which will give you access to all their projects and connected integrations. 

## Can I get chat support? 

Yes! Sleuth uses Tawk.to for chat support. Look in the lower-right hand corner of your [Dashboard](../dashboard.md) and click on the Tawk.to icon to get instant chat support \(available Monday thru Friday, 8 am to 5 pm PST\).
