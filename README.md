# Welcome!

Sleuth helps track software deployments through your remote team's complete DevOps stack. It also helps you improve uptime and stop change-related incidents before they ship. 

![The Sleuth Dashboard in action](.gitbook/assets/sleuth-help-dashboard-action.gif)

It only takes a few minutes to connect Sleuth to a change source and start analyzing the health of your code. 

A change source can be a code deployment on Bitbucket, GitHub or GitLab; feature flags on LaunchDarkly; or issues on Clubhouse or Jira, with [many other integrations](integrations-1/about-integrations....md) available.
