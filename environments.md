# Environments

Sleuth provides support for **environments** in ways that are familliar to developers. Environment modifications are made at the Sleuth [project](projects.md) level, and contain all the settings and configuration states for each environment, such as production, testing, and staging. 

 Changes made to settings and states apply only to the selected environment.

* Both production and staging environments are common.
* Create as many environments as your project needs. You can easily switch between environments using the environment selector underneath the project title in the Dashboard.
* If using manual deployments, you can specify the environment on the HTTP POST as the 'environment' field or let it default to the project's default environment.
* Selecting a default environment ensures itâ€™s displayed first when you visit the Dashboard. Default environment settings are also applied to any additional environments that are created.
