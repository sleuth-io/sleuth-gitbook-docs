# Impact

Impact is an important part of the Sleuth experience, and is one of the main metrics Sleuth computes to provide you with the overall health status of your deploys.

Impact lives at the Organization level, just like connecting GitHub or LaunchDarkly. A specific instance of impact lives at the Project level and applies to all changes made via a change source within that project. This is configured similarly to a shange source.
