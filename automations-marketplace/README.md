# Automations Marketplace (beta)

## Overview

Sleuth's **Automations Marketplace** provides a rich offering of [easy-to-install](installing-automations.md) automations designed to help teams drive improvements across their entire software delivery workflow!&#x20;

And the Automations Marketplace is much more than just a collection of automated tools to improve. It's a way to answer the question: _We've identified some bottlenecks, so now what?_ &#x20;

By [suggesting automations](smart-suggestions.md) that are designed to address your specific opportunities for improvement, and by providing [efficacy feedback](understanding-efficacy.md) to understand which automations are making a difference to your teams, the Automations Marketplace combines with Sleuth's powerful DORA metrics to provide a full-circle continuous improvement solution.  &#x20;
