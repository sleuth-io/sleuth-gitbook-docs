# Clubhouse

## About the Integration ![](../.gitbook/assets/clubhouse.png) 

Issue trackers are one of the key sources of change Sleuth needs to do its job. Once a issue tracker is integrated, Sleuth immediately begins its analysis. You'll instantly see the Deploy Graph come to life with a complete snapshot that gives you the information you need to start deploying faster. 

Integrating Clubhouse with Sleuth is easy. 

Check out the [Github](github.md), [Bitbucket](bitbucket.md), or [Jira](jira.md) integration pages if you'd like to track your issues using those tools instead or in addition to.
