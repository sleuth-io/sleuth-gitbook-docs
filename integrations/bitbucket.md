# Bitbucket

## About the Integration ![](../.gitbook/assets/bitbucket-2x-blue.png) 

Code repos are one of the key sources of change Sleuth needs to do its job. Once a code repo is integrated, Sleuth immediately begins its analysis, looking at your commit history, number of authors, deploy frequency, size of commits, and other data to give you a full picture of how you and your team are managing your project's codebase. You'll instantly see the Deploy Graph come to life with a complete snapshot that gives you the information you need to start deploying faster. 

Integrating Bitbucket with Sleuth is easy. If you're setting connecting to a personal Bitbucket repo, you just need your credentials. If you're part of a Bitbucket organization and aren't the owner, you will need permission to allow Sleuth to connect to the repo \(after you connect you'll be able to select individual private or public repositories\). 

You can connect as many repositories to a project as you'd like; be sure to name them accordingly in Sleuth. You will also be able to tell Sleuth whether it should manually register each deploy or automatically create deploys for every push to or tag on branch; it's completely up to you. This setting can be changed at any time. Additionally, you can configure your target branch to lock if it contains unreleased code. 

Check out the [GitHub](github.md), [Jira](jira.md), or [Clubhouse](clubhouse.md) integration pages if you'd like to track your issues using those tools instead or in addition to.
