# Integrations

Integrations allow Sleuth to communicate with the various CD/CI tools in your DevOps arsenal. They enable Sleuth to collect the information it needs to provide a comprehensive view of your deployments, ensuring that you always know what is happening with your code—commits, deploys, issues, feature flags—and communicating successful—or failed—deployments through the Slack integration. 

The following integrations are currently available, with more coming very soon: 

* [GitHub](github.md)
* [Bitbucket](bitbucket.md)
* [LaunchDarkly](launchdarkly.md)
* [Slack](slack.md)
* [Jira](jira.md)
* [Clubhouse](clubhouse.md)
* More coming soon...
