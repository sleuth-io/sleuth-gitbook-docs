## About the Integration ![](../.gitbook/assets/jira-software-2x-blue%20%281%29.png) 

Issue trackers are one of the key sources of change Sleuth needs to do its job. Once a issue tracker is integrated, Sleuth immediately begins its analysis.

Integrating Jira with Sleuth is easy.

Check out the [Github](github.md), [Bitbucket](bitbucket.md), or [Clubhouse](clubhouse.md) integration pages if you'd like to track your issues using those tools instead or in addition to.
