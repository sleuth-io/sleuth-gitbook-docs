# Getting started

Sleuth is a deployment tracker that helps you move fast without breaking things. It only takes a few minutes to connect Sleuth to a change source and start analyzing the health of your code. 

A change source can be a code deployment on GitHub/Bitbucket/GitLab; feature flags on LaunchDarkly; or issues on Jira/Clubhouse, with [many other integrations](integrations-1/about-integrations....md) available. 

To get started with Sleuth: 

1. **Create an account.** You can use an email address or connect via SSO thru Google, GitHub or Bitbucket. Read [Signing up](getting-started.md) for more information. 
2. **Name your project.** You can also add a description, which is optional. 
3. **Add a change source.** This can be a code deployment on [GitHub](integrations-1/change-sources/code-deployment/github.md), feature flags on [LaunchDarkly](integrations-1/change-sources/feature-flags/launchdarkly.md), issues from [Jira](integrations-1/issue-trackers/jira.md), or the many [other available integrations](integrations-1/about-integrations....md). 
4. **Add an integration.** An integration can be change sources, chat ops, issue trackers, and error and metric trackers. Make sure you have access credentials for any integration you want to connect. If you're part of an organization that has already set up a Sleuth environment and your email address uses the same domain, integrations might already be connected to your organization. In such cases, you won't need to add the integration yourself.  
5. **Add a change source.** A change source can be a code repo on GitHub, feature flags on LaunchDarkly, or infrastructure on [AWS](integrations-1/change-sources/infrastructure/aws.md). As in step 4, make sure you have access credentials for these services at your disposal.
