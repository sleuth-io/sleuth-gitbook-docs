  Start tracking the health and status of your deployments with Sleuth. You'll
  need a GitHub or Bitbucket repo at minimum to get started. Let's get you
  connected!

# Getting started

## Connecting the repo ðŸ“” 

If you haven't already signed up for a Sleuth account, [you'll need to do that first](./). Otherwise, let's continue by connecting Sleuth to your code repo: 

1. Go to the Sleuth [Dashboard](dashboard/). 
2. Select Create 

```
$ give me super-powers
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

{% code title="hello.sh" %}
```bash
# Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
{% endcode %}
