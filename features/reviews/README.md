# Reviews

Reviews combine metrics with written narratives to describe the current state of a team, a tribe, or your entire engineering org.&#x20;

They help engineering teams operationalize metrics by providing a repeatable [Review workflow](broken-reference) that guides them through reviewing, interpreting, and identifying actions from metrics.

Sleuth does most of the work of filling out Reviews by collecting data from your [integrated tools](broken-reference) and summarizing insights with its [AI assistant](broken-reference), so users can focus on refining the insights and adding needed narrative.

1. **Table of contents:** Provides links and "traffic light" scores for each Section in the Review
2. **Workflow buttons**: Advances the Review to its next state in the [Review workflow](broken-reference)
3. **Date range:** Determines the date range for data shown in the Review's [Widgets](broken-reference)
4. **Widget menu:** Menu of additional Widgets that can be added to the Review.&#x20;
5. **Review summary / Review score:** Top-level summary and score for the Review, typically set by the Review owner (either manually or by using Sleuth's AI assistant)
6. **Section owners:** User(s) assigned to complete a specific [Section](broken-reference) in a Review
7. **Section comments**: Used by Section owners and Review owners as they complete the Review
8. **Section summary /** **Section score**: Section-level summary and score, typically set by Section owners (either manually or by using Sleuth's [AI assistant](broken-reference))
9. **Widgets:** Configurable blocks of information (e.g. charts, text, images, etc.), arranged within Sections. &#x20;

### Sections and Widgets

**Reviews** are organized primarily into **Sections** and **Widgets**. A Review can contain any number of Sections, and a Section can contain any number of Widgets.&#x20;

Sections might also include a **Section summary** or **Section score**, both of which summarize the Widgets in the Section. See [Widgets and Sections](./#widgets-and-sections) for more information
