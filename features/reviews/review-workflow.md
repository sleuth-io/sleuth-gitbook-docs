# Review workflow

Sleuth Reviews follow a common workflow to help users:

* Review automated metrics
* Provide manual data (e.g. quantitative metrics, text, images)
* Add comments (as they collaborate on preparing the review)
* Add action items (to be reviewed in the next Review cycle)
* Add summary narratives and scores (manually or using Sleuth's [AI assistant](broken-reference))
* Share their completed reviews with stakeholders

### Review cycles

Engineering organizations have recurring **Review cycles** at all levels. Teams might perform daily stand-ups, weekly planning syncs, biweekly sprint reviews, or monthly retros. Managers report up to senior leaders who in turn report out to go-to-market teams, the board, or at all-hands. &#x20;

Sleuth's Review workflow aligns to cycles, guiding users to repeat activities on a predictable schedule.     &#x20;

### Review roles

Reviews always have one **Review owner** and might also have assigned **Section owners**. See more on these roles below.&#x20;

### Review states

All Sleuth reviews move through the following three states:

* **Draft:** This first state is where the Review owner sets up by arranging its [Widget and Sections](broken-reference) or assigning section owners in [Review settings](broken-reference). When ready, the Review owner moves the Review to the next state by clicking the **Start review** button.
* **In progress:** Most of the activity in a Review happens during the this state. If Section owners have been assigned, Sleuth sends them notifications to let them know them to complete their sections. Once the Review owner is satisfied that all Sections are complete, they **Publish** the Review to move it to the final state.
* **Published:** Sleuth "freezes" Reviews once they're published in order to preserve their history. Automated Widgets stop refreshing their data, and users are no longer able to edit the content of the Review. If needed, Review owners and admins can manually revert Reviews to **In progress** from [Review settings](broken-reference).

### Sharing Reviews

Once published, Review owners and section owners can share reviews by sending them as a link, downloading them as a PDF, or using **Presentation mode** to show them as a slide presentation from right within Sleuth.  Users can also use the **Share** button to send a link to the presentation view with anyone, even if aren't Sleuth [Users](broken-reference).
