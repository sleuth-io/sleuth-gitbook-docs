# Review templates

Recurring review cycles happen at all levels of a typical Engineering organization. Common examples include:

* Development teams have daily stand-ups, weekly status syncs, biweekly sprint reviews, or monthly retros&#x20;
* Engineering managers report to senior Engineering leaders
* Product managers report out to go-to-market stakeholders&#x20;
* CTOs report to the executive leadership team, the board, or at a monthly all-hands

Pulse comes with **Review templates** that bring the right metrics to the reviews you're already performing.&#x20;
