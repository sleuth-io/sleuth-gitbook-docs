# Inbox

Sleuth's Inbox shows all your Review-related "to dos" and @mentions in one place.

Inbox is especially useful when you're working on Reviews in multiple Teamspaces, giving you one place to see:

* Sections you've been asked to submit
* Sections submitted for your approval &#x20;
* Reviews awaiting publication
* @mentions

### Managing your Inbox

The Inbox is divided into two sections: **To dos** and **Mentions**

* **To dos** disappear from the Inbox automatically once they are completed. Click any To do item to navigate to the specific Review/Section that requires action.&#x20;
*   **Mentions** display a blue badge to indicate that they are unread. Click any mention to view the comment, and Sleuth will automatically mark it as read. Click **Mark all as read** to mark all Mentions in the Inbox as read.\
