# Surveys

Surveys let you send out questions to collect qualitative information from team members.

Sleuth's[ Survey workflow](survey-workflow.md) guides you through choosing the right questions, sending them to the right recipients, collecting their responses (all via Slack), and interpreting summarized responses with insightful data visualizations and [AI summaries](../ai-assistant.md).

You can then [add summarized results to a Review](../ai-assistant.md) to tell a rich story that combines qualitative and quantitative metrics.
