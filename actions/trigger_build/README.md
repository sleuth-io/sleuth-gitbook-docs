# Trigger builds

The `trigger_build` is an extremely powerful action that will trigger your repository's build. You can control what workflow is executed by specifying the parameters. Your [CI/CD integration](../../integrations-1/builds/) defines the required parameters for Sleuth to trigger the build process. 

The `trigger_build` action is best used in concert with Sleuth's [Slack based Approvals](../../slack-mission-control/approvals.md). Together they can be used to define your deployment workflow.
