# Dashboard



![](.gitbook/assets/dashboard-with-size.png)

All the data Sleuth collects about your code deployments is displayed in the Dashboard. The Dashboard is composed of the following elements: 

* **Sidebar** ðŸ‡¦ 

  The Sidebar provides quick access to your projects \(if you have more than one\), code deployments, feature flags, and impacts. 

* **Trend Graph** ðŸ‡§ 

  A visual representation of the changes that have have been made over the selected time range.

* **Magnitude** ðŸ‡¨ 

  This graph gives you a quick way to gauge the overall scope of your deployed changes. 

* **Deploys** ðŸ‡© 

  A running list of your deploys, shown in chronological order. Direct links are provided to the corresponding repos, allowing you to quickly see what changes were made. The magnitude of the deploy is displayed. Collectively, the magnitude of your deploys over the displayed time range impacts the magnitude graph.

* **Change Sources** ðŸ‡ª All of the sources of change connected to your project are displayed here. Collectively, all of the change sources combined drive the data shown in the main Trend GraphðŸ‡§.
