# Issue trackers

Once you've [connected your issue tracker](../../integrations-1/issue-trackers/) to Sleuth we'll automatically surface all the issues you are shipping in each deploy.

Sleuth provides quick links to your issues every where your issue key is referenced. Sleuth will pick up issues referenced in:

* Pull request titles and descriptions
* Commit descriptions
* Git branch names

See the p[roject settings details](../../settings/project/details.md) documentation on how to configure your issue tracker for your project.
