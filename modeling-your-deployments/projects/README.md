# Projects

**Projects** are the main container that Sleuth uses to organize your deployments. For example, a project can correlate to a product that your company offers, a collection of micro services or any collection of [deployments](../code-deployments/), [environments](../environment-support.md) and [impact sources](../../settings/project/impact.md) that model how you work.

A project gives you a high-level view your Accelerate (DORA) metrics and of all the changes and deploys happening within. With your project you can:

* See, at a glance, if it's safe to deploy your next change
* Track your Project's DORA metrics (deploy frequency, change lead time, change failure rate, MTTR and deploy size)
* Filter Project-level DORA metrics by specific Code deployments, environments, and contributing [Teams](../teams/)
* Know the latest change made to each deployment and it's drift from your other environments
* Slice and dice your past deploys via a [powerful search](../code-deployments/search.md)
* Configure Slack or Email deploy [notifications for your team or individuals](../../notifications.md)
* Know the health and Impact of your deploys via your key SLIs
