# Feature flags

Feature flags are an integral part of agile software development, and an important variable in deploying a successful CI/CD pipeline. Making high-impact changes with minimal risk and maximum control of your applications helps deliver quality software to your customers. 

Sleuth integrates with your existing [LaunchDarkly](../integrations-1/feature-flags/launchdarkly.md) account to surface your feature flag changes within your Sleuth project. Setting up feature flags in Sleuth allows us to track and alert on flag changes via the same mechanisms used for your code deploys, providing you a single system of record for all your deploy changes. 

Feature flag changes also trigger automatic health verification when you've setup Impact Sources.
