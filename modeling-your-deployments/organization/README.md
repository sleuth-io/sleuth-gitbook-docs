# Organization

An **Organization** is the top level container that Sleuth uses to organize your [Project's](../projects/). Most of your team will spend their time in the project and deployment level dashboards.

However, for managers or executives looking for the 50-foot view of their Organization's engineering efficiency Sleuth offers multiple ways to slice and dice your performance. &#x20;

![Organization Trends](<../../.gitbook/assets/Trends - Sleuth 2022-03-02 16-39-40 (1).png>)

With your organization dashboards you can:

* See DORA metric [Trends](trends.md) across any combination of [projects](../projects/) or [labels](labels.md)
* [Compare](compare.md) and contrast DORA metrics across any combination of [projects](../projects/) or [labels](labels.md)
* See the overall [Status](status.md) of your organizations [projects](../projects/) at a glance
* Get a snapshot view into exactly what's been changing across your [projects](../projects/)
* [Search](search.md) for any deploy across all of your organization's [projects](../projects/), [environments](../environment-support.md) via any dimension (issue key, pull request titles, author and more)
