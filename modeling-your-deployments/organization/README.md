# Organization

An **Organization** is the top level container that Sleuth uses to organize your [Projects](../projects/). Most Sleuth users will spend the majority of their time in the project-level, deployment-level, and team-level dashboards. However, for managers or executives looking for the 50-foot view of their Organization's engineering efficiency, Sleuth offers multiple ways to slice and dice your organization-wide performance. &#x20;
