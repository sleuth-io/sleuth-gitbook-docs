# Labels

Labels allow you to create flexible taxonomies to slice and dice your DORA metrics across your Organization. They are used to combine any number of [projects](../projects/) together for metrics comparison and trends.

Do you want to see how your Java-based projects compare to your Python-based projects? Perhaps youâ€™d like to know how your TDD projects stack up against non-TDD projects. Are one week or two week sprints more efficient?

Group your projects by coding language, sprint time or whatever dimension you want insights on.

### Managing Labels

You can manage your Organization's Labels via your Organization settings. You can quickly label multiple projects via the create/edit Label dialog. Labels are a light-weight construct that instantly allow you to generate additional cross-project DORA metric Trends and Comparisons.&#x20;
