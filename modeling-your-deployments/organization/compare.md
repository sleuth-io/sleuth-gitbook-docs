Do you want to see how your Java-based projects compare to your Python-based projects? Perhaps youâ€™d like to know how your TDD teams stack up against non-TDD teams. Are one week or two week sprints more efficient?

Using the Compare dashboard coupled with [Labels](labels.md) allows you to compare across any taxonomies or projects within your Organization.
