# Notifications

There are three different ways you can alert [Sleuth that a deploy has taken place](https://sleuth.io/):

1. [Manually register your deploy](manual-deploy-notification.md) by making a POST request to [Sleuth](https://sleuth.io/) each time you deploy. 
2. [Automatic tracking for each push](automatic-by-push.md) to the configured branch. Just push to your branch and watch the deploys roll in.
3. [Automatic tracking for each tag](automatic-by-tag.md) made against the configured branch. Just push up a new tag and [Sleuth](https://sleuth.io/) will do the rest.
