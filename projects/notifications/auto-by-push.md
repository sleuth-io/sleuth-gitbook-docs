# Auto by push

When this option is selected [Sleuth](https://sleuth.io/) will add a POST-commit hook to your repository on [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/).

This will ping [Sleuth](https://sleuth.io/) every time a commit is made. When we detect a commit against your projects branch we'll register a new deploy.
